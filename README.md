# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern: Task 2 - Inventory Management System using Python

Welcome to the Task 2 repository for the **Inventory Management System** using Python, part of my **Brainwave Matrix Internship**. This repository contains the code and resources for building an advanced inventory management system with features like product addition, deletion, stock tracking, and low-stock alerts, all managed through a graphical user interface (GUI).

## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a **fully functional Inventory Management System** that allows users to manage product inventories in a seamless and efficient way. The system provides a user-friendly GUI for product management and report generation, including low-stock alerts.

### Key Components

- **GUI Interface**: Built using Tkinter to create an intuitive user experience.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality to restrict access.
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, or delete products, and track stock levels.
- **Low-Stock Alerts**: Alerts the user when stock levels fall below a threshold.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures only valid data for product prices and stock quantities are entered.
- **Report Generation**: Generate reports for stock analysis, including low-stock alerts.

## üß† Project Workflow

1. **Login with Authentication**:
   - The system requires valid login credentials (default admin credentials are provided) to access the Inventory Management System.

2. **Add/Edit/Delete Products**:
   - Users can add new products, edit existing products, or delete them from the inventory.
   
3. **Low Stock Alerts**:
   - The system generates alerts if stock levels fall below a specified threshold.

4. **Generate Reports**:
   - Users can generate low-stock reports to track inventory levels and ensure sufficient stock is maintained.

5. **Exit**:
   - Logs the user out of the system, securing the data.
